      "Alright, so I need to write a haiku about Python. Hmm, okay, let's break this down. A haiku is a traditional Japanese poem with three lines: 5 syllables, then 7, then 5 again. It usually captures a moment in nature, but since it's about Python, I'll have to think of elements related to programming and maybe even incorporate some natural imagery.\n",
      "\n",
      "First, I should consider what aspects of Python are distinctive or well-loved. People often praise Python for its readability and simplicity. The syntax is quite clean compared to other languages. Maybe I can use metaphors that reflect that clarity.\n",
      "\n",
      "I remember the term \"Zen of Python,\" which includes sayings like \"Beautiful is better than ugly.\" Perhaps I can incorporate something about beauty or simplicity in the lines. Also, Python's philosophy emphasizes doing things right and not just quickly, so maybe that can be another angle.\n",
      "\n",
      "Looking at nature, maybe words like \"whisper\" or \"flow\" could work well. They evoke a sense of ease and naturalness, which fits with how Python is often described as elegant and easy to use.\n",
      "\n",
      "Let me try drafting some lines. The first line should have 5 syllables. Maybe something about the language's gentle nature? Like \"Whispers in the code.\" That's five syllables: whip-ers-in-the-code—wait, that's actually six syllables. Hmm, maybe \"Gentle whispers flow\" – that’s five.\n",
      "\n",
      "Second line needs seven syllables. Perhaps something about Python's simplicity or its structure. How about \"Simplicity finds its form\"? Let me count: sim-plic-i-ty-find Its-form. That's 7 syllables.\n",
      "\n",
      "Third line back to five. Maybe something that ties in the natural imagery with the language. \"Elegance blooms forever.\" Five syllables: e-le-gance-blooms-for-ev-er—wait, no, that’s too many. Let me adjust: \"Blossoms of code bloom free\"—that's 5.\n",
      "\n",
      "Wait, let me check each line again to ensure syllable counts are accurate and the imagery aligns with Python's characteristics.\n",
      "\n",
      "First line: \"Whispers in the code\"—6 syllables. Oops, needs to be five. Maybe \"Gentle code whispers\" – that's six again. Alternatively, \"Code whispers soft\"—5 syllables. That works.\n",

      "\n",
      "Third line: 5. Maybe \"Elegance endures,\" but that's five syllables: e-le-gance-en-dure. No, \"endures\" is two syllables. So, \"Elegance grows\"—that’s five? E-le-gance-grow – yes.\n",
